### Vehicle Catalog Application

##### About
This corresponds to my tutorial at [langworthytech.com](https://langworthytech.com/blog/category/building-vehicle-catalog/)

This is a simple Rest API CRUD Java application using the Spring Boot framework that retrieves 
information about a vehicle by passing a VIN (vehicle identification number) to the service.
 
If information for the VIN cannot be found in the Vehicle Catalog, it will contact a 3rd party Rest API Service
to retrieve and store the data.

This application is part of my "Learning Software Development" series , and aims to demonstrate the following 
best practices:
* Test Driven Development
* Refactoring
* Continuous Integration
* SOLID design principles
